MobileLua
=========

Update October 8, 2013
----------------------

I no longer actively develop MobileLua. I will keep this repositry here, because it contains code that could be useful for future implementations of Lua on mobile devices.

Description
-----------

MobileLua is a port of Lua to [MoSync](http://mosync.com/), a C/C++ 
cross-platform development system for mobile devices. This enables Lua 
to be used on a wide range of mobile devices.

News (old)
----------

MobileLua now wraps all functions and constants in the "mosync" namespace.

For example, when you previously wrote:

    Screen:SetColor(255, 255, 255)
    
You now write:
    
    mosync.Screen:SetColor(255, 255, 255)

    
The downloadable files for the LuaLive editor and client have been updated to use the new MobileLua version.

Note: The code for the old version of MobileLua that does not have the "mosync" namespace is available in branch "VersionOne".

Error handling
--------------

MoSync does not yet support exceptions or setjmp/longjmp, so Lua error handling 
is replaced with return in case of errors and check for error status. 
This is not implemented for all error conditions, so for some errors you can 
get incomplete error information, or in the worst case the program may hang or crash.

Example code
------------

The following is a very simple paint application. Supports multi-touch.
    
    -- Fill screen with background color.
    mosync.Screen:SetColor(255, 255, 255)
    mosync.Screen:Fill()
    mosync.Screen:Update()
    
    -- Function that paints a "brush stamp" on the screen.
    function Paint(x, y, touchId)
      if touchId == 0 then 
        mosync.Screen:SetColor(0, 0, 0) 
      else
        mosync.Screen:SetColor(0, 200, 0) 
      end    
      mosync.Screen:FillRect(x - 20, y - 20, 40, 40)
      mosync.Screen:Update()
    end    
    
    -- Bind the Paint function to touch events.
    mosync.EventMonitor:OnTouchDown(Paint)
    mosync.EventMonitor:OnTouchDrag(Paint)
